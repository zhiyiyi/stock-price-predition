    "## Introduction\n",
    "In today's fast-paced and ever-changing world of finance, investing in the stock market can be a daunting task, especially with the added uncertainty brought on by events like the COVID-19 pandemic. Many investors find it challenging to make informed decisions, particularly when it comes to choosing stocks like Microsoft. The problem our team aims to tackle is how to provide investors with better insights and tools for making investment decisions in this volatile market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we want to solve this problem? We understand that investing can be a path to financial security and growth, and we want to empower investors with the right tools and information. Microsoft, being a significant player in the tech industry, attracts considerable attention from investors. By developing a machine learning model to predict Microsoft's stock price, we hope to assist investors in making more informed decisions, reduce uncertainty, and potentially increase their chances of financial success.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to harness the power of data and cutting-edge technology to create a predictive model that can analyze historical stock data, market trends, and other relevant factors. This model will provide insights into Microsoft's stock price movements, offering investors a valuable resource to make smarter investment choices in uncertain times. Ultimately, our team is dedicated to using our skills to provide a solution that can benefit both novice and experienced investors in their quest for financial stability and growth in the stock market."

    "## ELT Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we can build a predictive model of Microsoft's stock data, we need to access all the relevant information to the stock's price action. Lucky for us, a developer named [@ranaroussi](https://github.com/ranaroussi) and other generous contributors have developed an open-source Python package known as `yFinance`, which allows users to access historical stock market data for many companies in the major stock market indices, such as the NASDAQ or the S&P 500.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access this rich and dynamic data source, we've built an **Extract, Load, and Transform (ELT) Pipeline** to seamlessly move data from the source (\"extract\" if you will), \"load\" it in a data storage tool which, in this case, is the MotherDuck cloud warehouse, and conduct our \"transformations,\" analysis, and modelling in toolsets such as this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We conducted the *extraction* process through Python scripts within this repository, such as the `initialize_load.py` and `extract_stock_data.py`, which, in short, allowed us to pull data straight from the `yfinance` API and into an in-memory DuckDB database initially. From creating our DuckDB database, which we saved locally as `stock_data.duckdb`, we attached our database file to the MotherDuck cloud warehouse to collaborate openly on this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can access the cloud-stored dataset from the line of Python code, `con = duckdb.connect(f\"md:?motherduck_token={token}\")`, we can consider our process a success as we're now able to apply the data cleaning, transformations, visualizations, and algorithms we need to build a successful prediction model. To gain a high-level perspective on our project's architecture, we've included the diagram below to illustrate our process:\n",

This distribution provides insights into the typical range of closing stock prices and the presence of potential outliers or extreme values.

Subsequently, there was a noticeable decline to around \\\\$200 in 2022, followed by a swift rebound, surpassing the previous peak and exceeding \\\\$350 in 2023.
